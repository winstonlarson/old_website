Some coding and analysis projects of which I am particularly fond.

[###BRFSS](/brfss)

The BRFSS is the largest health survey in the world, with over 400,000 interviewees every year and a few hundred variables. There is a ton you can learn from the BRFSS about population health, trends in behaviors, and demographic differences in health and disease outcomes. It is a huge, messy data set, but once you've got it cleaned up, there's a lot to play with.
