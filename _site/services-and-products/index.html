  <p>Services-based business models are all the rage these days. We used to buy our CRMs; now Salesforce is software as a service. People still buy cars, but it’s easy to imagine a future where Uber and ZipCar provide the same functionality purely through a service model. Of course, it’s easy to see the value and allure of services. Uber, which will get a car to your door, has a private valuation now somewhere north of $60B. Ford, on the other hand, actually makes the cars, but their valuation floats around $50B. There are no two ways about it: Understanding the customer’s real problem (getting from point A to point B as easily as possible) and finding a great solution to it unlocks enormous value.</p>

<p>That being said, great danger lurks around the corner for services-only businesses. In our free market, there will inevitably be competition, and services businesses can be incredibly difficult to differentiate. You see, without an underlying product, they have almost nothing with which to create barriers to entry for competitors. Undifferentiated competition leads to price wars and ultimately the destruction of value. Uber is awesome. But so is Lyft. And without a change in their current offerings, they’re basically in a race to the bottom.</p>

<p>How do you avoid this race to the bottom, but still grab all that value that is sitting in services? Create offerings that involve both products and services. They support and symbiotically multiply each other.</p>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-services-based-business-models">The rise of services-based business models</h2>

<p>What is a service? Completing a task that generates ephemeral value. What is a product? An enduringly valuable “item” that helps to complete a task. What do you get when you put them together? Lasting value from repeatedly completed tasks.</p>

<p>Services and products are nothing new, and neither is combining them. A farmer provides a critical product: food. A cook renders a critical service: cooking that food. Combine the two, and you have something that is more valuable than both put together: a restaurant. Just look at all that synergy.</p>

<p>An old example is financing a car through the dealer. Major car makers like Ford and GM started out by, you guessed it, making cars. But they realized that the average American was held back from buying all their cars because they couldn’t afford the upfront cost and credit was hard to come by for something so frivolous. The car manufactures added a service to their product: they would help you finance the car. The service made customers happy because they could now buy a car and drive around. The car companies liked it because they could sell more cars, not to mention all that money they made off the loan interest.</p>

<p>The car companies that didn’t offer financing couldn’t sell as many cars. Banks are all basically the same: similar service, similar interest rates, similar terms. There was nothing to differentiate them. Combine the two, though, and you’ve got something exciting. You can differentiate through your product (e.g. the fastest car) and actually capture value through the service (helping customers pay so they’ll actually buy the car).</p>

<p>Sometimes the products are hidden. For most of us, Google looks like a service. We ask it a question, it gives us an answer. We think that it gives the best answers, and that’s why we use it. Actually, Google has a product underlying its service. Their proprietary algorithms, data farms, etc. are what allow it to provide those best search results. You could call their product “search infrastructure” or something like that. Bing has a search infrastructure, too, but apparently it is inferior, or otherwise everyone would have switched by now. Note, too, that if Google had stopped investing in its product (search infrastructure) 10 years ago, they wouldn’t be on top anymore, no matter how popular they were back then.</p>

<h2 id="the-danger-in-only-doing-services">The danger in only doing services</h2>

<p>You have to have a product to drive your services. Without a product, you cannot differentiate your service. You might be able to early on by being the first in the market. But when everyone sees your remarkable power, they will want in, and our free market will then push all of you into a price war. You will try to differentiate on customer service or something like that, but at the end of the day, your offering will look like a commodity.</p>

<p>The classic example are the airlines. Boeing and Airbus make the airplanes. The airlines just use those planes to offer the service of getting you across the country in a few hours. But they are all basically the same: tiny amounts of legroom, high baggage fees, and a nasty experience all around. Airlines that try to differentiate through extras (like JetBlue and its free checked bags) generally can’t offer those extras for long (JetBlue stopped offering free checked bags). The airlines have no product to differentiate themselves on, and it’s a race to the bottom. I have a lot of airline miles, and I still make my airline ticket purchases based purely on how much they cost.</p>

<p>Brands are nice, but they really aren’t enough. United wants you to “fly the friendly skies,” but you really just want a cheap ticket. The skies aren’t that friendly anyway.</p>

<p>Uber understands this. They realize that they are offering a service, and that without an underlying product to support long-term differentiation, they’re going to battle Lyft for the lowest fares. That’s why they are sinking millions into the development of driverless cars. If successful, they will have a unique product that they can use in their service model to capture enormous value.</p>

<h2 id="shoring-up-your-services-model">Shoring up your services model</h2>

<p>I hope I’ve made a good case that you need a product to sustain your services business model. How can you develop products that will strengthen and protect your services offering?</p>

<h3 id="listen-to-the-customer">Listen to the customer</h3>

<p>By operating a service, you deal with the customer directly. Ford would love to hear what people have to say about cars, but Uber actually knows. They actually hear from the drivers and the passengers. They know what these people care about (and, equally important, what they don’t). This type of information is incredibly valuable. You can leverage that information to create products that are actually tailored to customer needs rather than just guessing. Your products will not only be perfected for adding your services business model, but people will like them more because you are offering what they actually want.</p>

<h3 id="invest-in-rd-continuously">Invest in R&amp;D continuously</h3>

<p>Product R&amp;D always sounds like something for product-based companies. Apple does R&amp;D because they need to make better iPhones. Boeing needs to do R&amp;D because they need to sell safer, more efficient aircraft. But because you need a product to differentiate your services, you should be sinking money and talent into R&amp;D, too. Google provides its amazing search services by spending heavily on R&amp;D to support the product that underlies those services. They are also looking forward: they are trying to develop new products in other fields so that they can offer even better services and product-service combinations.</p>

<h3 id="start-small">Start small</h3>

<p>If you currently operate a services-only model, you can’t just jump into products tomorrow with a huge, market shaking offering. I mean, you could, but it’s highly unlikely that you will succeed. Uber is taking a huge bet on driverless cars because those don’t exist yet. They’re definitely not trying to compete with GM and Ford on standard cars right now.</p>

<p>Start small. Test your ideas. Use that customer feedback to improve your product. With that knowledge, you will have a view into where the industry is moving in the future. Use that knowledge to beat everyone else to the punch and get into the next wave early.</p>

<h3 id="integrate-with-your-service">Integrate with your service</h3>

<p>The best products are tightly integrated with their services counterpart. Ideally, they should be inseparable. GE successfully made this transition with their jet engines. You don’t buy a GE jet engine anymore. You buy time on that engine. GE will take care of making the engine as well as all the service and maintenance on it. You will always have a working engine. GE’s engine is built specifically to be easily monitored and tracked so that they can provide the service to their customers.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-your-business">Protecting your business</h2>

<p>By combining your products and services, you can change the basis of competition. You won’t just be selling cars. You will be selling transportation solutions. But you will also be able to protect yourself from competitors. And then you can go build yourself that nice house overlooking a tropical paradise.</p>
