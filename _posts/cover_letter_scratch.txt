Hi!

Data science and machine learning are fascinating and powerful tools, especially in solving the challenges confronting healthcare. I am passionate about data, and I also have extensive experience in life science R&D. I think that a job in data science at Apixio would be exciting, fun, and challenging, and that my combination of skills and experience will make me a valuable contributor.

I have a deep engineering education and a broad portfolio of side projects in data science. I am fluent in Python and Matlab and have used these tools on a variety of projects. I learn quickly and am a skilled problem solver, and I can rapidly learn new tools and methods. Currently, I am a strategy consultant at Innosight, where I have gained extensive expertise in life science R&D. I have worked with multiple major healthcare companies and examined healthcare delivery from all angles. Beyond healthcare, I have a wide variety of projects that demonstrate my competence in research, analysis, and management.

Not only will I be a capable data scientist, but I can also help you build your business. I bring valuable strategy consulting experience, where I have become an experienced communicator and skilled in project management. I am looking for a role where I will be constantly learning and will be able to wear multiple hats. I value autonomy, a research-oriented environment, and small teams.

I look forward to chatting with you about data science at Apixio.
