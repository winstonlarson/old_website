## Bio

I bring a research-oriented mindset and iterative, hypothesis-driven approach to solving ambiguous problems. I rely on data, technical skills, and a detail-focused management style to drive complex projects. I have a diverse background in innovation, R&D management, mechanical engineering, and industrial manufacturing that enables me to better understand problems and identify solutions.

I currently work at Innosight, an innovation and strategy consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. Cofounded by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, we focus on helping established companies adapt to industry dynamics and harness the power of disruptive innovation. I personally specialize in R&D strategy for high technology, heavy industry, and biopharma.  I am interested in the ways business model innovation can combine with breakthroughs in basic science or technology to create growth opportunities for new businesses and products.  I have worked with pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, and manufacturing clients to create research accelerators and implement R&D programs. I have extensive experience in managing and directing the R&D process in the context of high technical and market uncertainty.

Prior to Innosight, I completed engineering internships in the aerospace and petroleum industries, where I helped to develop new capabilities in advanced manufacturing techniques and technologies. I was also a co-founder of an alternative energy startup at MIT.

I received SM and SB degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My graduate research centered on applying disruptive innovation theories to energy and robotics research, trying to understand the research capabilities and technological breakthroughs that underly successful disruptive innovations. My other research interests include robotics, manufacturing, data science, and energy.

In my spare time, I am a voracious reader. I especially enjoy reading history and biographies. I enjoy traveling with my wife, visiting art museums, and experiencing life in Cambridge, Mass (when the snow isn't over our heads).
