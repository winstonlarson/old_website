##The challenge of R&D-driven business
Research and development remains one of the most vexing challenges in business. One way to solve the problem is through start ups. The VC community is in many ways the early research funding arm of the technology industry. However, many important scientific and engineering challenges are not conducive to the VC cycle (e.g. most of biology). In addition, many large companies that are interested in new ideas and can contribute significant value, but they are obviously not startups. These companies spend billions and billions of dollars on research and development projects every year trying to come up with the next big thing. But too often it feels like money down the drain due to canceled projects, missed deadlines, and broken promises. How can companies (large or small, new or old, private or public) effectively minimize the risk inherent in R&D programs, while also ensuring that projects are managed to seize on new opportunities?

At [Innosight](http://www.innosight.com), I have focused on helping R&D-driven companies build research and commercialization strategies to bring cutting edge science out of the lab and onto the market. I have real world experience in using theories and models like disruptive innovation, technology road-mapping, and corporate venturing. I deeply understand the challenges of R&D and bringing complex science to market.
