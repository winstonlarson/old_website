note: How Google Abicus's probability-based identity system counter-intuitively mimics the brain's concept of identity
---

Google made waves this week when it introduced [Project Abacus](http://9to5google.com/2015/05/29/smart-lock-passwords-is-cool-but-google-project-abacus-wants-to-eliminate-password-authentication/), a new prototype identification system. Instead of relying on passwords, Google proposes to use behavior to confirm a user's identity online. This feels like a pretty shocking idea: instead of using a binary confirmation of who we are (i.e. we know our password), Google basically wants to say that it's fairly certain that it thinks it knows who we are. However, this system of using probabilities to confirm identity is not only going to be more secure, it also actually mimics the we we think about identify ourselves.

While this may seem shocking and dangerous at first, there is some sound reasoning as to why this could ultimately be a more secure way to manage online identity. Security experts have
