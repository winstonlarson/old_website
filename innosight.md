##The challenge of R&D-driven business
Research and development remains one of the most vexing challenges in business. One way to solve the problem is through start ups. The VC community is in many ways the early research funding arm of the technology industry. However, many important scientific and engineering challenges are not conducive to the VC cycle (e.g. most of biology). In addition, many large companies that are interested in new ideas and can contribute significant value, but they are obviously not startups. These companies spend billions and billions of dollars on research and development projects every year trying to come up with the next big thing. But too often it feels like money down the drain due to canceled projects, missed deadlines, and broken promises. How can companies (large or small, new or old, private or public) effectively minimize the risk inherent in R&D programs, while also ensuring that projects are managed to seize on new opportunities?

At [Innosight](http://www.innosight.com), I have focused on helping R&D-driven companies build research and commercialization strategies to bring cutting edge science out of the lab and onto the market. I have real world experience in using theories and models like disruptive innovation, technology road-mapping, and corporate venturing. I deeply understand the challenges of R&D and bringing complex science to market.

##Consulting experience
Here are some of the spaces I worked in, experiences and expertise I gained, and solutions I helped create. To respect client confidentiality, I cannot discuss projects in detail, but I think that this gives a good flavor of my business, management, and corporate R&D experience.

###Domain expertise

####Pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and healthcare

**Immunology:** The immune system, its genetic underpinnings, and immune-based drugs. Autoimmune diseases and R&D projects into new therapies and MOAs.

**Oncology:** General genetic and biochemical processes that cause cancer. Evaluating new therapies and treatment modalities, especially in early cancer stages.

**Microbiome:** Potential treatments relying on the microbiome. Experimental processes, especially in computational microbiology. Popular open source packages, databases, and end-to-end solutions for target genome, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic analysis.

**Pharmaceutical R&D:** Modern pharmaceutical R&D processes and practices. Pre-discovery, discovery, pre-clinical, and clinical (Phases I, II, and III) stages.

**Pharmaceutical life cycle planning:** Building plans for patent expiration and biosimilar/generic introduction. Evaluating alternative business models.

**Health insurance:** Current health insurance market and payor dynamics. Future models for healthcare delivery and payment, especially value-based systems (e.g. ACOs).

####High technology and industrials
