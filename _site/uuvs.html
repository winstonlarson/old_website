  <h1 class="page-title">Unmanned underwater vehicles and disruptive innovation</h1>
  <hr />

<p>The naval warfare environment is rapidly changing. The U.S. Navy is adapting by continuing its blue-water dominance while simultaneously building brown-water capabilities. Unmanned systems, such as unmanned airborne drones, are proving pivotal in facing new battlefield challenges. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are emerging as the Navy’s seaborne equivalent of the Air Force’s drones. Representing a low-end disruptive technology relative to traditional shipborne operations, UUVs are becoming capable of taking on increasingly complex roles, tipping the scales of battlefield entropy. They improve mission outcomes and operate for a fraction of the cost of traditional operations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, long-term underwater power sources currently under development at MIT will extend UUV range and operational endurance by an order of magnitude. Installing these systems will not only allow UUVs to complete new, previously impossible missions, but will also radically decrease costs.</p>

<p>I explored the financial and strategic implications of UUVs and long-term underwater power sources to the Navy and its future operations. By examining current naval operations and the ways in which UUVs could complement or replace divers and ships, I identified ways to use UUV technology to reduce risk to human life, decrease costs, and leverage the technology learning curve. I concluded that significant cost savings are immediately available with the widespread use of UUVs, and current research investment levels are inadequate in comparison with the risks and rewards of UUV programs.</p>

<h2 id="uuvs-and-naval-disruption">UUVs and naval disruption</h2>

<p>A copy of my <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/87959/880676433-MIT.pdf?sequence=2">master’s thesis</a> is available from DSpace@MIT. You can also learn more about <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/NovelUUV.html">Professor Doug Hart’s research in to UUV power sources</a> at MIT.</p>

<h3 id="unmanned-underwater-vehicles">Unmanned underwater vehicles</h3>

<p>As the U.S. Military maintains readiness to wage war with traditional nation-states as well as with terrorist groups, unmanned and autonomous systems are revolutionizing warfare. Aerial drones have been wildly successful, and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are an opportunity for the U.S. Navy to increase its capability and effectiveness in a similar way under the sea.</p>

<p>Unmanned underwater vehicles are used in a variety of military, scientific, and industrial settings. There are three classes of UUVs: autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and underwater gliders. The diversity of vehicle types and sizes offers flexibility in application and deployment, a key benefit to using UUVs.</p>

<p>Long-term power sources will drastically improve the usefulness of the UUV technologies. An aluminum-based power source being developed at MIT under the direction of Professor Doug Hart is projected to offer an energy density of 8000 MJ/L, a 1000% improvement over current energy storage technologies. The improved range and power capabilities of UUVs equipped with such a power source will be a strategic advantage.</p>

<h3 id="disruptive-innovation-and-battlefield-entropy">Disruptive innovation and battlefield entropy</h3>

<p>Disruptive innovations are those which improve a product along new performance metrics. Disruptive technologies improve through sustaining innovation (improvement along existing performance metrics) to displace existing technologies. Disruptive innovation plays an important role in maintaining combat superiority. Submarines, aerial drones, and cruise missiles are all examples of disruptive military innovations. There is significant first-mover advantage in adopting and skillfully managing disruptive innovation.</p>

<p>Unmanned underwater vehicles are disrupting manned sea platforms. Though they are in many ways not as capable as ships or divers, they offer improved performance in cost, difficulty of detection, and flexibility. Not only are UUVs an opportunity, but they are also a threat. Other navies are also investing in UUVs, including Russia, China, and Thailand, as well as drug cartels and terrorist groups.</p>

<p>Battlefield entropy measures the difference between an entity’s ideal fighting force and its actual combat effectiveness. Even if a combat entity possesses superior force, or is not experiencing attrition, its combat effectiveness will decrease as the entropy it experiences increases. Weapon systems (broadly defined as any element providing force) decrease battlefield entropy for the user and increase entropy for the opponent. Given a more effective weapon, a greater change in entropy will be experienced. Disruptive military innovations represent characteristic improvements in battlefield entropy, and UUVs offer a unique opportunity for the Navy to change battlefield entropy in its favor.</p>

<p>Disruptive innovation must be skillfully managed to realize its full potential. Four theories (jobs-to-be-done theory, market/application identification, discovery-driven planning, and resource-process-value theory) provide best practices for identifying, adopting, and applying disruptive innovations well.</p>

<h3 id="uuv-mission-cost-analysis-and-comparison">UUV Mission cost analysis and comparison</h3>

<p>To demonstrate the disruptive power of UUVs, I analyzed the costs of missions that can be completed using current UUV technology. I examined the mission scenarios, the cost of completing the mission using manned systems, and the cost of completing the mission using UUVs. I compared the costs and analyzed the advantages of using UUV technologies. In the table below, I present the percent cost savings experienced by using UUV technologies rather than manned systems. In general, UUV systems are roughly an order of magnitude (90% cost savings) less expensive than manned systems.</p>

<h3 id="implications-of-uuv-adoption">Implications of UUV adoption</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I offer several observations on UUVs and their disruptive potential to naval operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UUVs offer significant cost savings</li>
  <li>Manned platforms are expensive</li>
  <li>Aluminum power sources are an important step forward</li>
  <li>UUVs are not one-size-fits-all</li>
  <li>UUVs represent a significant change in battlefield entropy</li>
  <li>Nonconsumption and overshooting offer many immediate UUV applications</li>
  <li>The low costs and disruptive nature of UUVs will make them attractive to other navies and entities</li>
</ul>

<p>Unmanned underwater vehicles will revolutionize naval warfare. Proper innovation management and early, enthusiastic adoption is required to seize their strategic potential and maintain maritime superiority.</p>
