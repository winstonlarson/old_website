note: How Google Abicus's probability-based identity system counter-intuitively mimics the brain's concept of identity
---

Google made waves this week when it introduced Abicus, a new prototype identification system. Instead of relying on passwords, Google proposes to use behavior to confirm a user's identity online. This feels like a pretty shocking idea: instead of using a binary confirmation that we are who we say we are (i.e. we know our password), Google basically wants to say that it's fairly certain that it knows that we are who we say we are. But this system of using probabilities to confirm identity is not only going to be more secure, but it also actually mimics the we we think bout identify ourselves.

While this may seem shocking and dangerous at first, there is some sound reasoning as to why this could ultimately be a more secure way to manage online identity. Security experts have
