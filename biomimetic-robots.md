##Challenges in bio-mimetic underwater robotics
Underwater robots are becoming increasingly important to naval and maritime science operations. Not only are larger, torpedo-sized robots important for things like mine-hunting, but smaller, fish-sized robots are important for fitting into tight spaces for inspections or to observe wild-life. Seaborne robots must be robust and durable to survive in the harsh ocean environment, and many applications for smaller robots also require agility and speed. An exciting way to achieve agility and speed is to create bio-mimetic robots, or robots that mimic the swimming mechanics of fish and other sea creatures (e.g. stingrays, squid). For example, MIT developed the RoboTuna in the 1990's to demonstrate the potential of fish-inspired underwater vehicles.

In the past, biomimetic underwater robots (e.g. robotic fish or stingrays) relied on segmented body designs, where each segment is individually actuated, to bestow agility and speed on their designs. For example, a fish tale would be made up of several segments, each of which would be controlled by a servo motor. Unfortunately, these segmented designs are not robust and suffer from high failure rates. Segment assemblies can fail, motors can burn out, or controllers and power sources can become overwhelmed.

##Under-actuated flexible bio-mimetic robots

At MIT, I was part of a team that designing a bio-mimetic underwater robots, including fish, stingrays, and salamanders. Our designs sought to solve the durability and failure issues of other bio-mimetic robots. They used one or two actuators, and relied on the mechanics of soft polymer bodies to create extra degrees of motion that resulted in underwater thrust.

###Developing a bio-mimetic stingray

The bulk of my work focused on building a small bio-mimetic stingray.

####Physical construction

Our stingray was constructed of a soft polymer body with only two actuators. I designed and demonstrated the control and actuation system to enable forward and backward motion and turning using only the two actuators. I also built and tested a robotic salamander that could both swim and walk.
