title: Book review: Doing Data Science
note: An introduction to data science by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, *Doing Data Science: Straight talk from the frontline* is a great survey of the space, though it might try to do too much.

Even though it sometimes feels differently, data science as a field and a profession is fairly new. Sure, sure, statistics and stuff aren't, but the hype and unbounded optimism are recent occurrences. And that's not a bad thing. It's great to feel like you're getting in on the ground floor of something that is amazing and will grow to be even more so.

## *Doing Data Science: Straight talk from the frontline*

This book is written to give an overview of the space to those who are trying to jump in. Based on a class at NYU, it covers the major ideas, value, and applications of data science, a review of the underlying maths, a tour of the major algorithms and methods, and a taste of important new developments like map reduce.
