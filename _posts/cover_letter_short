Hi!

I am excited about data science at Spreemo. I believe that I will be a great fit. I bring a unique combination of skills and experience in innovation strategy, R&D management, mechanical engineering, and data science.

I am currently a strategy consultant at Innosight, where I have gained extensive expertise in life science R&D. I have worked with multiple major healthcare companies and examined healthcare delivery from all angles.

Beyond healthcare, I have cultivated a large portfolio of projects demonstrating my research, analysis, and management abilities. I am fluent in Python and Matlab and have used these tools on a variety of projects. I have a deep engineering education and a portfolio of side projects in data science.

I bring valuable business consulting experience. I am an experienced communicator, skilled in project management, and work well in cross-functional teams.

My skills and experience will make me a valuable addition to your team. I look forward to chatting with you about how I can contribute at Spreemo.

Looking forward to getting in touch.

Winston Larson
